Alternate World

Alternate World is a mod for HOI4 taken place in 2080-4000. North America is now the North American Union (1 country) and IKEA has bought Sweden. Tensions are rising in the world as North Korea and China throw citizens into prison with no care who despise their leader. After the first collapse of the United Nations, the NAU has formed them again trying to spread world peace before World War 3 breaks out.
